## 📝 About This Application

External_Rust_Cheat_AI is a tool designed to assist players in the game Rust. It uses advanced technology to read and write game memory, allowing users to gain an edge in gameplay through features that operate quietly in the background.

The software runs a special hidden program called a kernel-mode driver. This driver works deep inside your computer to avoid detection by Rust’s security system (Easy Anti-Cheat). It uses smart techniques to unlink itself from normal system checks and takes special measures to remain hidden while interacting with the game.

Users can control and configure the software using a built-in menu system that appears on the screen. This menu is simple to navigate and helps turn features on or off without any technical knowledge.
